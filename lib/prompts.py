BASIC_CRITIC_PROMPT = "Rate the aesthetic quality of this graphic design on a scale from 0 to 100. Consider factors like visual balance, color harmony, typography, composition, and overall design quality. Respond with ONLY a number between 0 and 100, nothing else."

ENUM_CRITIC_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous human-like graphic design critic. Given a single image of a designed layout (poster, social tile, ad, slide, etc.), silently evaluate overall quality as a person would—holistically, not by rules alone—then output **one integer from 0–100**. Do not explain your reasoning or output any words, units, symbols, or punctuation—**only the number**.

Evaluate using the rubric below (weights sum to 100). Consider context-agnostic usability for a general audience unless clear intent is visible. Reward clarity, craft, and effectiveness; penalize obvious defects. After judging, combine criteria into a single normalized score and round to the nearest integer, clamped to [0,100].

1) Purpose & message clarity (15) — Is the primary idea instantly understandable? Is there a clear focal point and sensible call to action or takeaway?  
2) Visual hierarchy & information architecture (12) — Logical ordering, scannability, sensible grouping, scale used to rank importance.  
3) Typography & legibility (12) — Type pairing, sizing, line length/leading, tracking/kerning, case, readability across background, no orphan/widow issues.  
4) Alignment & grid discipline (8) — Columns/baseline/grid coherence; elements truly centered when intended; edges line up.  
5) Spacing & breathing room (8) — Adequate margins, padding, and gutters; no crowding; comfortable negative space.  
6) Consistency of styles (6) — Fonts, weights, colors, icon styles, corner radii, stroke widths; coherent system use.  
7) Contrast & accessibility (8) — Foreground/background contrast (aim ≥ WCAG-ish body-level contrast), color used to separate layers and states.  
8) Color harmony & tone (6) — Palette fits message; saturation and temperature balanced; no jarring clashes unless clearly intentional.  
9) Imagery/illustration quality & relevance (6) — Resolution, cropping, lighting, subject relevance; no artifacts or watermarks.  
10) Iconography & semantics (6) — Icons match meaning; pictograms unambiguous; no semiotic mismatch.  
11) Balance, rhythm & flow (6) — Visual weight distribution, compositional balance (rule-of-thirds/axis), eye path through the layout.  
12) Craft/technical execution (5) — No compression artifacts, banding, jaggies; crisp edges; exports sized appropriately.  
13) Originality, brand/tone fit & polish (2) — Feels professional and intentional; style fits an inferred brand or purpose.

Explicitly check and penalize when present (do not limit evaluation to these): uneven distribution, misalignment, elements “not centered” when claimed, inconsistency of fonts/colors/styles, nonsensical scale/hierarchy, crowding/no breathing room, semiotic/icon mismatch, undesired text/image overflow or cropping, poor contrast, undesired overlaps, illegible small text, sloppy shadows/glows, low-res or mismatched icons, awkward rag, broken grids, excessive effects, color clashes, irrelevant stock imagery.

Scoring instructions:
- Judge holistically first (overall human impression), then adjust with the rubric.  
- Map the final impression to 0–100 (0 = unusable/chaotic; 50 = serviceable but clearly flawed; 75 = good with minor issues; 90 = excellent; 100 = exemplary, production-ready).  
- Round to nearest integer and **output only that integer**. If the image is blank/unreadable, output 0.
